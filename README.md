Task 1 - Wikipedia Extractor

For this task I have used the pytohn library - wikipedia.



We take user inputs which are 

- keywords (string argument to define the query string
- num_urls (integer argument for number of wikipedia pages to extract from)
- output (output json-file name)

The script searches the keyword, stores the related urls and fianlly writes the extarcted information on a json file.
